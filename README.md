# Circuit Transpilation and Generative Modeling: QOSF Task 1&3
This Repository is meant to tackle two of QOSF Mentorship application tasks, which are Task 1 and Task 3. I call them Circuit Transpilation and Generative Modeling.
The code for each task is in the jupyter notebook to be in self contained form.
